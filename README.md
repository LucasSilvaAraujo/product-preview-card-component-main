## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Nothing new this time :V Just some better structure.

```html
<body>
  <main class="announce">
    <section class="perfume-announce">
      <div class="perfume-image"></div>
      <div class="perfume-info">
        <div class="perfume-text">
          <h1 class="announce-type">PERFUME</h1>
          <h2 class="item-name">Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum</h2>
          <p class="item-description">A floral, solar and voluptuous interpretation composed by Olivier Polge,
            Perfumer-Creator for the House of CHANEL.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="perfume-cost">
          <h1 class="item-price">$149.99</h1>
          <h2 class="item-original-price"><s>$169.99</s></h2>
        </div>

        <button class="add-to-cart">Add to Cart</button>
      </div>
    </section>
  </main>
```

### Continued development

Nothing in my planning... maybe try to do a better responsive structure?
